As long as the CP is at least as long as the dispersive delay of the channel, the CP, rather than
the front-end data symbols, will absorb any residual symbol spreading (i.e., ISI).

noncoherent O-OFDM, coherent optical OFDM(CO-OFDM, preserve the phase), and all-optical OFDM (AO-OFDM),
Finally, coherent detection increases receiver sensitivity,
It is noted that, in the case of coherent detection, since optical phase information is
preserved and CD-induced power fading would thus no longer occur with a DSB O-OFDM signal

Unlike in O-OFDM, in CO-OFDM, the optical carrier does not have to be transmitted along with the O-OFDM sideband; a receiver-side local oscillator (LO) can be used instead.},

  Abstract                 = {Data-over-cable service interface specifications (DOCSIS),the de facto standard in the cableindustry, defines a scheduling service called real-time polling service (rtPS)to provision quality of service (QoS) transmission of real-time variable bitrate (VBR) videos. However, the rtPS service intrinsically has high latency,which makes it not applicable to real-time traffic transport. In this paper,we present a novel traffic scheduling algorithm for hybrid fiber coax (HFC)networks based on DOCSIS that aims to provide QoS for real-time VBR videotransmissions. The novel characteristics of this algorithm, as compared tothose described in published literatures, include 1) it predicts the bandwidthrequirements for future traffic using a novel traffic predictor designed toprovide simple yet accurate online prediction; and 2) it takes the attributesof physical (PHY) layer, media access control (MAC) layer and applicationlayer into consideration. In addition, the proposed traffic scheduling algorithmis completely compatible with the DOCSIS specification and does not requireany protocol changes. We analyze the performance of the proposed traffic predictorand traffic scheduling algorithm using real-life MPEG video traces. Simulationresults indicate that 1) the proposed traffic predictor significantly outperformspreviously published techniques with respect to the prediction error and 2)Compared with several existing scheduling algorithms, the proposed trafficscheduling algorithm surpasses other mechanisms in terms of channel utilization,buffer usage, packet delay, and packet loss rate.},

owing to, thus increasing
pre-emphasis

In the proposed system, the transmission power of each wireless signal is adjusted by
simple 1-tap real-valued multiplication to roughly equalize the EVM. This pre-emphasis increases the
number of wireless signals which meet the required EVM without increasing the average transmission power.

The networks between BBUs and RRHs are referred to as the mobile front-haul (MFH).

To further improve the capacity, 256-QAM is used in LTE-B while 64-QAM is the highest modulation scheme
in LTE-A.},
