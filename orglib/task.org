**** ICA to [CQJ]
[2015-03-30 Mon]
重点在于橙色模块。华为的方案是采用LTE的上行DFT-S，但是方案有如下弊端：
1. PAPR很高18dB (6 chns), 28dB (48chns)， 采用ICA几乎不变， 为11dB. 2)
IFDT size 是6400,  RRH复杂度很高，ICA不需要那么复杂的IDFT， 只需要时域
上的重复和相位旋转。

MFH 发送端： 
1.	MFH 发送端:　在BBU LTE-A信号之后时域上重复N次 (N为channel数目)
2.	之后做相位旋转: 每个IF做对应的相位旋转，使得信号在频域上交织
3.	然后所有的IF再叠加
   
RRH 接收端：
1.	经过光通道后，在频域上做均衡FDE用来做光通道上的补偿
2.	之后再对各自进行对应的相位逆旋转得到最初的LTE-A信号

若有解释不周的地方，请交流。

**** ICA,  spectrally-interleaved
 1) Proposed  ICA consisting of repetition and phase rotation is employed
    between BBU and OLT Tx ports.
    1) For downlink direction, each digital BB data from a specific BBU
       is repeated in time domain at first to enlarge spectrum for all
       OFDM data in frequency domain.
    2) Then the repeated OFDM signal is multiplexed by a specific phase
       to make each signal spectrally-interleaved. All OFDM signals are summed
       and then modulated onto a Tx over a specific wavelength in the
       OLT.
 2) Key architecture and technology description in RRH:
    1) FDE is used to make equalization in frequency domain
       to compensate for fiber dispersion and then specific inverse
       phase rotation is implemented to drop the target data on its
       corresponding IF.

 1) Proposing SFBC and FBMC for converged mobile and optics

    1) #Simulation demonstration of FBMC and SFBC for Converged
       Mobile and Optics#
       1) Simulation of FBMC to suppress sidelobes
       2) PAPR and EVM performances to be measured for FBMC.

    2) FBMC in MFH:

       1) PAPR issue is a challenge even for FBMC
	  although FBMC can resolve IMD issue due to very low side-lobe
	  leakage. Furthermore, as for MFH, so many FBMC based IFs will
	  make the transmitter and RRH receiver have a large PAPR. How to
	  address this issue is a big challenge: hybrid FDD/TDD or
	  interleaved mode.  Hybrid FDD/TDD may face time delay and sync
	  issues. Interleaved mode should carefully consider CFO
	  problems.

    3) Proposing SFBC in MFH:

       1) it can resolve the seamless
	  connection between optics and wireless due to random
	  distribution of UEs. As we know, SFBC is employed in current
	  LTE system to utilize frequency diversity in the MIMO
	  system. However, SFBC in MIMO is not yet considered in the
	  converged optical and wireless system. 

 2) Converged Optical-Copper-Radio Access Network (COCRAN)

    1) #SFBC for Converged Optical-Copper-Radio Access Network (COCRAN)#

    2) SFBC simulation for COCRAN

    3)  SFBC to reduce crosstalk in the Converged
       Optical-Copper-Radio Access Network (COCRAN): crosstalk issue
       should be carefully considered to reduce interference from the
       other 3 wired lines. MIMO may be a solution to tackle this
       issue.

 3) Continuously Make progress in interconnection between two USRP2s
    for CoMO Demo

    1) #installing Ubuntu-14.04 and GNURadio on the new PC#

    2) install Ubuntu-14.04 and GNURadio on the new PC

 1) Proposing software-defined MFH to support 96 E-UTRA-like IFs

    1) #Simulation demonstration of software-defined MFH enabling 96
       E-UTRA-like IF signals#
       1) 16 IFs for each bandwidth 1.4, 3, 5, 10, 15 and 20 MHz, respectively.

       2) software-defined QPSK, 16QAM and 64QAM for E-UTRA

       3) PAPR and EVM performances to be measured.

    2) Proposing software-defined MFH
       1) Enabling ICA based 96-IFs: 16 IFs for each bandwidth 1.4, 3, 5, 10,
          15 and 20 MHz, respectively.
       2) finished DFT-S based MFH of 36 E-TRAN-like IF channels. But
          the complexity is huge due to a M-point IDFT processing
          (M-12288). Moreover, PAPR is large as 19dB, which will a
          bottleneck especially for transmitter in the uplink.

       3) Current stage: finished ICA based MFH supporting 96
          E-UTRA-like IF channels and software-defined QPSK, 16QAM and
          64QAM and can be fulfilled.

       4) PAPR can be reduced from 19 to 11-dB by employing the novel ICA architecture. 

 2) Working on patent: "Interleaved Channel Aggregation Based
    Multi-Intermedia Frequency Over Fiber System"

    1) #Finished an invention: a novel ICA based Multi-IFoF with simpler
       architecture and lower PAPR (8 dB reduction)#

       1) support 48 IFs for C-RAN

       2) low complexity and PAPR

    2) Working on patent: 

       1) high capacity for future CRAN: more than 48 IF channels, not
          supported by current CPRI based MFH.

       2) a cost-effective Multi-IFoF generation architecture between
          BBU pool and RRH for A-RoF based MFH: no need of complex
          filter design and multiple N-point DFTs and an M-point IDFT
          processing

       3) low PAPR: decreasing PAPR is a key issue especially for the
          transmitter in uplink.


**** Monthly-report, [2015-03-27 Fri]
1) Continuously make progress to enhance performance for CoMO
   system
   1) #Proposing Interleaved Channel Aggregation algorithm
       for MFH#

      1) Proposing new algorithm for MFH

      2) Decrease PAPR for MFH

      3) Make MFH system cost-effective
   2) Proposing Interleaved Channel Aggregation (ICA) algorithm
       for MFH to support dense IFs and make system cost-effective:

      1) ICA proposal has lower PAPR than Huawei's DFT-S
         method-(PAPR decreased from 18 to 11dB for 6 channel
         aggregation)
      2) ICA proposal has lower complexity, due to simple repetition
         and phase rotation in time domain; however, the Huawei's
         proposal needs high-complexity FFT-(M (6400) point-IDFT).

   3) Optical transmission for the proposal  employing Optisystem
       should be performed, especially for high-level 1024-QAM.

   4) Preparing technical report "Technical Report on Interleaved Channel Aggregation
       Based Mobile Fronthaul" for deliverable report_Q12015: it is
       time-consuming to write report, but valuable for me to
       summarize latest research. 

2) Continuously make progress in interconnection between two USRP1s in
   narrowband for CoMO Demo

   1) #Success in interconnection using FDD method  between two USRP1s in
      narrowband for CoMO Demo: decreased ping delay#
      1) decrease ping

      2) More in code tunnel.py

   2) Success with gmsk modulation (800kbps), but large delay
   3) decrease ping delay by FDD: discussed  with technical
          supporters and decided to employ FDD solution, so try to
          use 2.41G and 2.5G to suppress the interference for
          tunnel. tried many times, but still failed.
   4) FDD: 2.41G and 2.5G, ping is decreased from 1-2s to 80ms
      1) Node1 initiates the ping request to node2, node2 should
         send back ARP reply.
      2) When the reply is too short, node1 can not receive reply.
      3) So increase reply time
   5) fix code in tunnel.py
      1) time.sleep(0.009) # delay 9ms before sending out the
         reply. And then the ping delay can be decreased to 80ms, so
         video transmission becomes better.

   2. FIXED NETWORKS: Analog-Over-Fiber Enlarges Mobile Fronthaul Capacity
      1. We demonstrated analog mobile fronthaul over PON at Bell Labs
	 Shanghai, showing 96 x 20 MHz LTE channels, each up-converted as
	 a subcarrier and combined into a single wavelength 2 GHz analog
	 signal that is transported over 20 km of fiber. The approach
	 with a single 2 GHz transceiver promises to be more cost
	 effective than the conventional CPRI fronthaul capacity of
	 120Gbps, requiring either multiple WDM channels or costly 100G
	 transport systems. We achieved the largest number of LTE
	 channels over an analog optical link reported in the literature
	 and attribute the success to our development of wireless-fiber
	 joint channel estimation, intelligent nonlinearity management
	 for inter-modulation mitigation, and adaptive equalization based
	 self-learning algorithm.

*** RE: Your Invention Submission -  818074, [2015-09-18 Fri]
    1. Crucial - "10x" If analog fronthaul becomes deployed instead of
       CPRI or midhaul in 5G, which is a realistic avenue given the
       cost of CPRI and many Chinese research efforts look into this,
       then this invention shows significant improvements in #
       channels and PAPR
       1. key issues in CPRI: limited capacity of 10Gbps (only to
          support 8 Channels) and requires expensive high-speed
          optical transmitter and receiver
	  1. ARoF can transmit awireless signal with the same optical
             bandwidth as thewireless bandwidth but the signal quality is
             degradedcompared with DRoF.
       2. analog fronthaul will become deployed to replace CPRI in
          5G: NTT DOCOMO in Japan, ETRI in Korea and Huawei in China
          are doing great efforts to deploy analog mobile fronthaul.
       3. this invention verifies significant improvements in channel
          numbers and PAPR, which can't be easily designed around.
    2. Current CPRI can't support future CRAN in 5G because it has limited capacity of 10Gbps (only
       supporting 8 channels) and requires expensive high-speed
       optical transmitter and receiver. Analog fronthaul will become
       deployed to replace CPRI in 5G due to high capacity and keep
       the same optical bandwidth as the wireless. Therefore, Huawei
       in China, NTT DOCOMO in Japan and ETRI in Korea are doing great
       efforts to deploy analog mobile fronthaul for future high-speed
       CRAN in 5G.
    3. As we know, the shortage of the current CPRI solution is the
       limited capacity and high cost. That’s why people are pursuing
       other alternative solutions to get a trade-off between the
       performance and the complexity & cost. Analog fronthaul is now
       being regarded as the main fronthaul solution by more and more
       vendors and industry.  Huawei, NTT DOCOMO in Japan and ETRI in
       Korea, and some other research organization have been doing
       great efforts on analog mobile fronthaul. They’ve already got
       much progress in research work and demonstration as some papers
       shown. Due to the obvious advantage in the capacity increase,
       it is believed that the analog fronthaul will be the dominate
       fronthaul solution serving the future CRAN in 5G era, and much
       possibly implemented in the future products. This patent can
       well protect our IPRs on this cutting edge technology and
       prevent others from using the similar approach.

 5) no OLT and just 1 RRH with multi-IF (channels)
*** What is the technical problem that the inventor(s) had to solve
 1) One known form of  channel aggregation based
    Multi-Intermedia Frequency over Fiber (MultiIFoF) for mobile
    fronthaul (MFH) is DFT-S channel aggregation method proposed by
    Huawei. However, it should be noted that the proposal by Huawei has
    its complexity with N-point DFT and M-point IDFT processing, and
    may be not applied in MFH uplink, due to repeated DFT-S solution
    for LTE uplink. Furthermore, its PAPR is pretty high with large
    M-point IDFT (6400), making RRHs cost-consuming.  In order to
    improve the performance of MultiIFoF based on MFH,  this invention
    provides interleaved channel aggregation (ICA) with lower PAPR and
    simpler architecture.
 2) One known form of channel aggregation based Multi-Intermedia
    Frequency over Fiber (Multi-IFoF) for mobile fronthaul (MFH) is
    DFT-S channel aggregation method proposed by Huawei in Asia
    Communications and Photonics Conference (ACP) 2014 (Authors: Xiang
    Liu et al., AF4B–5). However, it should be noted that the proposal
    by Huawei has its high complexity with N-point DFT and M-point
    IDFT processing. Furthermore, its PAPR is pretty high with large
    M-point IDFT (M is 6400), making OLT and RRHs cost-consuming. In
    order to resolve the challenges posed by Huawei's proposal, this
    invention provides novel interleaved channel aggregation (ICA)
    based Multi-IFoF with simpler architecture and lower PAPR (7dB
    reduction for green power solution). Moreover, it can support 48
    LTE-A IFs with very low PAPR (17 dB reduction), for both downlink
    and uplink in MFH, which may be viable technical solution for
    future centralized radio access network (C-RAN) in LTE-A or 5G
    networks.

 1) values
    1) high capacity: 48 IF channels, not supported by current CPRI
       based MFH. Moreover, it will support more than 48 IFs for
       future high-capacity CRAN

    2) an cost-effective Multi-IFoF generation architecture between
       BBU pool and RRH for A-RoF based MFH: no need of complex filter
       design and multiple N-point DFTs and a M-point IDFT processing

    3) low PAPR: decreasing PAPR is a key issue especially for the
       transmitter in uplink.

 2) likelihood

    1) very likely due to high capacity requirements for C-RAN in LTE-A or 5G (48 IF channels or more).

    2) Moreover, it exhibits obvious performance enhancement, for example, low PAPR for RRH

 3) designed around

    1) The proposed solution is a broad architecture for a
       cost-effective MFH system based on an unique interconnection
       between BBU pool and RRH, so the invention can't be easily
       designed around.

**** Abstract 
  1) [YCH]
     This document describes technical feasibilities of the analog over
     wireless fronthaul links with obvious capacity improvement over
     current digital protocols such as CPRI. A set of
     various experimental validations have been carried out in serial and
     technical results have been analyzed. As the results indicate, the
     transmission bandwidth in the optical fronthaul can be much relieved
     and therefore fronthaul capacity over one single wavelength can be
     greatly enhanced, which is appealing to current wireless fronthaul
     applications with rapid capacity expansion.
  2) revised
     This document presents technical achievements of  analog
     multiple LTE-A IFs over optical fiber links with lower PAPR and
     simpler architecture than the proposal by Huawei, employing DFT-S
     channel aggregation method. Detailed simulation results verify
     that the interleaved channel aggregation proposal for mobile
     fronthaul (MFH) outperform Huawei's DFT-S. Moreover, it can support
     48 LTE-A IFs with very low PAPR, for both downlink and uplink in
     MFH, which may be viable technical sulotion for future centralized
     high capacity mobile access network.

 Instead of transmitting quantized bits, RF symbols
transmitted over the fiber link sustain in analog format for spectral
efficiency enhancement

With the massive increases in mobile data traffic enabled by the
emerging long term evolution (LTE) or advanced technologies, baseband
processing centralization has introduced large capacity explore in the
fronthaul using current fronthaul protocols, e.g., Common Public Radio
Interface (CPRI). To combat against the traffic congestion in the
fronthaul link, we hereby propose IF-over-fiber architecture that
facilitates wireless access and MFH transport for C-RAN implementation
of next generation. Instead of transmitting quantized bits, RF symbols
transmitted over the fiber link sustain in analog format for spectral
efficiency enhancement; meanwhile, IF multiplexing technology has also
been introduced to facilitate multiple channels of wireless data’s
transmission parallelly in the fronthaul link. To realize that, we
hereby demonstrate a wireless-optical converged access (WOCAS)
solution, in which fiber transmission link is treated as an extinction
part of the wireless interface. Therefore, comparing to conventional
CPRI protocol, channelization in the fiber link will be added into the
hybrid channelization of the wireless interface. As a result, signal
degradation in the fiber link has to be considered and compensated in
pre- or post- compensation procedurals. Furthermore, with the increase
of channel quantities in the fronthaul link, inter-modulation
distortion will be a major source of error, therefore, special
technology has been introduced in DSP for error free transmission.  A
serial of tests have been performed and analysis/conclusions are
achieved based on. In the serial test, 1channel, 2 channels and 8
channels of wireless data are carried and transmitted over the WOCAS,
respectively. Key technical parameters are described and key outputs
are analyzed. As the tests and evaluation results indicate, challenges
as they are have be resolved and tremendous improvement in the
transmission capacity enhancement of the wireless-optical-converged
fronthaul system and robustness for wireless access service has been
achieved. Based on that, we treat this new solution as a most
promising candidate for Future XG featured access solution.


***** [HXA]
Emerging long term evolution (LTE), LTE-A and future 5G require
baseband processing centralization, thus centralized radio access
network (C-RAN) architecture has been introduced to improve network
performance and increase network capacity. Mobile fronthaul (MFH), as
a key of C-RAN network, builds a cost-effective connection between centralized baseband units (BBUs)
and remote radio heads (RRHs), and is primarily realized by common public radio interface (CPRI) that
transmits digitized baseband signals via on-off-keying (OOK). 

However, the OOK based CPRI is not spectrally effective and requires
expensive high-speed optical transmitter and receiver to support high
data rate. To combat against the traffic congestion in the
CPRI link, IF-over-fiber architecture that facilitates wireless access
and MFH transport for C-RAN implementation of next generation has been
reported by researchers, for example, Huawei proposed efficient mobile
fronthaul transmission of multiple mobile channels in a single wavelength
channel through DFT-S channel aggregation method.

But, it should be noted that the proposal by Huawei has its
complexity with N-point DFT and M-point IDFT processing, and can not be applied in MFH uplink, due to
intrinsic DFT-S solution for LTE uplink. Furthermore, its PAPR is
pretty high with larger M-point IDFT (6400), making ONUs cost-consuming. 
 
Therefore, comparing to DFT-S proposal by Huawei, interleaved channel
aggregation method has been firstly proposed to make transceiver
cost-effective and lower PAPR. As the tests and evaluation results
indicate, challenges posed by Huawei's proposal have been resolved and
great improvements in system capacity and PAPR performance have been 
achieved. Based on that, this new solution can be treated as a most
promising candidate for future C-RAN access solution.

*** Fixed Networks and NECT: Demonstration of 25 Gb/s TDM-PON with Standard Class Optical Budget and 20 km Reach using 10 Gb/s Optical Components

    1. We demonstrated the technical feasibility of a symmetrical 25
       Gb/s TDM-PON with a 20 km reach and 31.5 dB optical power
       budget using only 10 Gb/s optical components. We accomplished
       this by using PAM4 downstream to boost the transmit signal with
       an optical amplifier, and duobinary upstream for burst mode
       transmission. We applied very simple low cost pre-distortion
       schemes and commercial real-time EDC to increase dispersion
       tolerance and implemented optical amplification at the CO side
       (shared cost) to achieve an optical power budget of 31.5 dB for
       a 20 km reach and 33 dB for a 10 km reach. Our technology
       enables increasing the serial bit rate of PON beyond 10 Gb/s to
       25 Gb/s at a similar cost and performance as 10 Gb/s
       PON.

** Fixed Networks and NAPS: Mobile Front-haul using Latency-improved TDM-PONs
Transport of mobile front-haul traffic has a very tight latency
requirement of about 250us one-way and the best solutions today are
based on expensive point-to-point (PtP) fiber links and PtP
WDM. TDM-PON is less expensive but has a poor latency of about 1ms. We
have found ways of reducing TDM-PON latency to acceptable levels of
250 usec or less. We accomplished this by using queuing theory to
analyze the total latency and derived closed-form formulas that allow
understanding of the tradeoffs enabled by the different system
parameters. We have illustrated multiple application scenarios in
which TDM-PON has acceptable latency, and have shared our results with
the Fixed Networks CTO.

**** Proposing MIMO (SFBC) and FBMC for converged mobile and optics [2015-05-22 Fri]
  1) Proposing MIMO (SFBC) and FBMC for converged mobile and optics
     1) Challenges of converged MFH: 1) Seamless connection between
        fiber and wireless (or copper crosstalk issue) 2)
        Inter-modulation distortion between IFs. 3) Random
        distribution of UE (first consideration in optical domain)

     2) Proposing SFBC in MFH: it can resolve the seamless connection
        between optics and wireless due to random distribution of
        UEs. As we know, SFBC is employed in current LTE system to
        utilize frequency diversity in the MIMO system. However, SFBC
        in MIMO is not yet considered in the converged optical and
        wireless system.

     3) FBMC in MFH: PAPR issue is a challenge even for FBMC although
        FBMC can resolve IMD issue due to very low side-lobe leakage.

  2) Continuously Make progress in interconnection between two
     USRP2s  for CoMO Demo: decrease ping delay more. 

**** COCRAN and (Software-defined Converged Access Network)- SCAN, [2015-05-15 Fri]

  1) MFH

     1) Challenges of OFDM in MFH: 1) frequency offset of subcarriers is
	a drawback especially for uplink. 2) inter-modulation distortion
	between IFs due to high sidelobe leakage.

     2) Proposing FBMC in MFH: it can resolve the frequency offset and
	cancel the CP, which is an important issue for high speed
	5G. Moreover, very low sidelobe leakage is very benefit for MFH.

     3) FBMC or UFMC in MFH: UFMC is more flexible and does not require
	complex filter design.  So UFMC may be more viable in MFH. And
	PAPR and EVM performance should be compared between FBMC and UFMC
	in MFH system.

  2) Converged Optical-Copper-Radio Access Network (COCRAN)

     1) MIMO to reduce crosstalk in the Converged Optical-Copper-Radio
        Access Network (COCRAN): crosstalk issue should be carefully
        considered to reduce interference from the other 3 wired
        lines. MIMO may be a solution to tackle this issue.



**** [2015-05-08 Fri]

 1) Proposing a new modulation scheme for mobile front-haul uplink
    1) Challenges of OFDM: 1) offset of subcarriers is a drawback
       especially for uplink. 2) CP is required to mitigate ISI, so it
       will lower bandwidth efficiency.

    2) FBMC may be a viable solution for 5G due to cancelation of CP
       and robustness against subcarrier frequency offset. Key of
       FBMC: 1) Offset QAM to fully utilize spectrum resources; 2)
       design the poly-phase filter.

    3) FBMC for MFH: it can resolve the frequency offset and cancel
       the CP, which is an important issue for high speed 5G. Also,
       these issues are also important for MFH, due to fiber
       dispersion and higher capacity. So, FBMC as a baseband module
       should be considered for next generation MFH.

**** [2015-04-29 Wed]

 1) Continuously Proposing Interleaved Channel Aggregation based
    software-defined MFH to support 96 E-UTRA-like IFs.
    1) 16 IFs for each bandwidth 1.4, 3, 5, 10, 15 and 20 MHz,
       respectively.

    2) CFO pre-compensation may be applied in MFH to simply RRH and
       compensate phase offset due to fiber transmission.
    3) EVM performances are firstly measured for all 64QAM
       transmission in 96 channels: the larger bandwidth, the worse
       EVM (the worst is 0.026).
    4) Pre-compensation can be utilized to compensate the EVM penalty
       especially for optical transmission of large bandwidth IF
       signal.

    5) Then flexible 4-256QAMs are transmitted, and even 256QAM can
       be sucessfully transmitted with 0.016-EVM. 
    6) PAPR can be reduced from 19 to 11-dB by employing ICA.

 1) Continuously Proposing Interleaved Channel Aggregation based software-defined MFH to support 96 IFs and make system cost-effective and flexible.
    1) Simulation demonstration of software-defined MFH enabling 96
       E-TRAN-like IF signals: 16 IFs for each bandwidth 1.4, 3, 5,
       10, 15 and 20 MHz, respectively. Current stage: finished ICA
       based MFH supporting 96 E-TRAN-like IF channels and
       software-defined QPSK, 16QAM and 64QAM and can be fulfilled.
    2) CFO pre-compensation may be applied in MFH to simply RRH and
       compensate phase offset due to fiber transmission.
    3) PAPR and EVM performance should be measured to ensure the proposal.

**** [2015-04-10 Fri]

 1) Enhance performance for CoMO system
    1) Reviewing papers of OFC 2015: The research about “Real
       time IFDMA-PON” by Kenji Ishii1 in Mitsubishi Electric
       Corporation is pretty interesting, proposing
       IFDMA/OFDMA/SC-FDMA-PON co-existence and CFO
       pre-compensation.
    2) Our proposed ICA maybe coexisting with DFT-S
       by Huawei, and CFO pre-compensation may be applied in MFH to
       simply RRH and compensate phase offset due to fiber
       transmission.
    3) Revising patent of proposed “Interleaved Channel
       Aggregation Based Multi-IFoF System For Mobile Fronthaul”: This
       invention provides ICA based Multi-IFoF with simpler
       architecture and lower PAPR (8 dB reduction for green power
       solution). AWG should be deleted due to repetition with ADC in
       the architecture.

 2) narrowband for CoMO Demo
    1) interconnect with Video
       1) FDD: 2.41G and 2.5G, ping is decreased from 1-2s to 80ms

       2) Ping delay 80ms is still not enough for video interconnection
 3) OFDM for CoMO Demo

**** [2015-03-27 Fri]

 1) Enhance performance for CoMO system
    1) Proposing Interleaved Channel Aggregation (ICA) algorithm
       for MFH to support dense IFs and make system cost-effective.
    2) Preparing technical report "Technical Report on Interleaved Channel Aggregation
       Based Mobile Fronthaul" for deliverable report_Q12015: it is
       time-consuming to write report, but valuable for me to
       summarize latest research. 

 2) narrowband for CoMO Demo
    1) interconnect with Video
       1) FDD: 2.41G and 2.5G, ping is decreased from 1-2s to 80ms

       2) Ping delay 80ms is still not enough for video interconnection
 3) OFDM for CoMO Demo

**** [2015-03-20 Fri]
 1) narrowband for CoMO Demo
    1) interconnect with Video
       1) FDD: 2.41G and 2.5G, ping is from 1-2s to 100ms
	  1) Node1 initiates the ping request to node2, node2 should
             send back ARP reply.
	  2) When the reply is too short, node1 can not receive reply.
	  3) So increase reply time

    2) fix in tunnel.py
       1) time.sleep(0.009) # delay 9ms before sending out the
          reply. And then the ping delay can be decreased to 100ms, so
          video transmission becomes better.

 2) OFDM for CoMO Demo
 3) Enhance performance for CoMO system
    1) Proposing Interleaved Channel Aggregation algorithm
       for MFH to support dense IFs and make system cost-effective:
       Interleaved proposal has lower complexity and PAPR than that
       of HUAWEI-(PAPR decreased from 18 to 11 for 6 channel aggregation)

    2) Optical transmission for the proposal  employing Optisystem
       should be performed, especially for high-level 1024-QAM.

**** [2015-03-13 Fri]
 1) narrowband for CoMO Demo
    1) interconnect with Video
       1) Success with gmsk modulation (800kbps), but large delay
       2) decrease ping delay by FDD: discussed  with technical
          supporters and decided to employ FDD solution, so try to
          use 2.41G and 2.5G to suppress the interference for
          tunnel. tried many times, but still failed.
       3) maybe USRP1 can not support video Interconnection.
 2) OFDM for CoMO Demo
 3) Enhance performance for CoMO system
    1) Proposing Interleaved channel aggregation algorithm
       for MFH to support dense IFs and make system cost-effective:
       Interleaved proposed has lower complexity and PAPR than that
       of HUAWEI. PAPR performance of my proposal is half of HUAWEI's
       SC, due to time interleaved solution. Moreover, that will decrease ONU's
       cost and support both uplink and downlink for CoMO.

**** [2015-03-06 Fri]
1) narrowband for CoMO Demo
   1) interconnect with Video
      1) Success but low speed (100kbps)
      2) ping duration is 2ms, and delay is large, so try to decrease delay by using
         gmsk modulation, but still fail.
2) OFDM for CoMO Demo
   1) Success in benchmark_tx and benchmark_rx interconnection in OFDM
      1) 
   2) Stuck in /tunnel.py
      1) ping is not yet fulfilled. I think modulations of psk and
         qam in OFDM is not easy to be detected for USRP.
      2) try to solve ping issue, but still fail
3) Enhance performance for CoMO system
   1) Proposing an advanced channel aggregation algorithm for MFH to
      support dense IFs  and make system cost-effective: no need of
      complex FIR design and lower complexity. The algorithm has lower
      complexity than that of HUAWEI's proposal.
   2) Initiate optical transmission for 1024QAM employing Optisystem:
      in the simulation, receiver can not recover incoming signal,
      due to simulation issue.

**** [2015-02-06 Fri]
1) USRP
   1) Interconnection: try to fix the existing interconnection problem of
      USRP1 and USRP2, still struggling
2) Continuously Enhance performance for CoMO system
   1) 200MHz*16CHNs MFH has been successfully verified: at first
      64QAM-OFDM has been successfully received.
   2) 1024QAM-OFDM has been required to be validated after group
      discussion.
   3) Make progress to realize 1024QAM transmission 
#   3) 1024QAM-OFDM has been validated for MFH system.

**** [2015-01-09 Fri]
2) Continuously Enhance CoMO system
   1) Initialize TDD algorithm research for CoMO system to support
      48-IF: It can relieve complex FIR design and lower PAPR, but the
      drawback is its huge bandwidth occupy.

Continuously Enhance OFDM-PON Mobile Front-Haul MFH system
1) Completed MATLAB simulation of SC-FDMA: 7-dB PAPR can be enhanced
   than that of OFDMA-(FFT size is 256, 16QAM).
2) Denser IF channels for mobile front-haul: key limited
   factor is high PAPR, due to inherent OFDM modulation format and
   dense IF channels.
3) Updated  equalization algorithm: current preamble
   structure is not flexible for much larger FFT size. And IFFT size
   of LTE is 1024 or 2048, therefore, current equalization algorithm
   must be replaced.
Continuously Reviewed journal papers about SCFDMA-PON
1) SC-FDMA algorithm: There are two modes to generate SCFDMA
